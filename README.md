# Power-BI-Dashboard-for-Weather-Forecasting
This repository contains a comprehensive project that combines Python for data analysis and Power BI for data visualization, focusing on Weather-Forecasting data. The project demonstrates how to extract insights from raw  data and transform it into interactive, visually appealing dashboards.

# Tool used: Python and Power BI

# Data Analysis with Python:
Cleaned and preprocessed Amazon sales data using Pandas.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.


# Data Visualization with Power BI:
Created dynamic dashboards that provide an interactive user experience.
Visualized key metrics.
Integrated slicers and filters for deeper data exploration.

# Files Included:
Python scripts for data cleaning and analysis.
Power BI file (.pbix) containing the final dashboard.
Documentation on how to reproduce the analysis and set up the Power BI dashboard.

# How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the Python scripts to preprocess and analyze the data.
Open the Power BI file to explore the interactive dashboard.

# Requirements:
Python 3.x
Power BI Desktop
Required Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
This project is a great resource for anyone looking to learn how to combine Python and Power BI for data-driven decision-making. Explore the repository and see how you can apply these techniques to your own datasets!
